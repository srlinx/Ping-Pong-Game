# Python Ping Pong Game #

This is a classic ping pong game created using the Python programming language and the Turtle library. The objective of the game is to bounce the ball back and forth between the two paddles without letting it hit the edges of the screen.

## How to Play ##
Run the ping_pong.py file in your Python environment.
Use the 'W' and 'S' keys for left paddle and 'Up' and 'Down' for right paddle to move the left paddle up and down respectively.
Use the up and down arrow keys to move the right paddle up and down respectively.
The game starts as soon as you run the file and the ball will automatically start moving towards a random direction.
If the ball hits the left or right edge of the screen, the game is over and the player who missed the ball loses the game.
The first player to score 5 points wins the game.
